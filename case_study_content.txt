B2B SaaS Platform Testing - Multi-Platform Automation
Overview
You're joining the QA team at "WorkFlow Pro" - a B2B project management SaaS platform. The platform serves multiple clients (multi-tenant), works across web browsers and mobile devices, and integrates with various third-party services.
Time Allocation
Take-Home Portion: 90 minutes maximum
Live Discussion: 30-45 minutes (scheduled separately)

Part 1: Debugging Flaky Test Code (30 minutes)
A previous intern wrote this Playwright test for user login functionality. The test is flaky - sometimes passes, sometimes fails in CI/CD pipeline.
import pytest
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def test_user_login():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch()
        page = browser.new_page()
        
        # Navigate to login page
        page.goto("https://app.workflowpro.com/login")
        
        # Fill login form
        page.fill("#email", "admin@company1.com")
        page.fill("#password", "password123")
        page.click("#login-btn")
        
        # Verify successful login
        assert page.url == "https://app.workflowpro.com/dashboard"
        assert page.locator(".welcome-message").is_visible()
        
        browser.close()

def test_multi_tenant_access():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch()
        page = browser.new_page()
        
        page.goto("https://app.workflowpro.com/login")
        page.fill("#email", "user@company2.com")
        page.fill("#password", "password123")
        page.click("#login-btn")
        
        # User should only see Company2 data
        projects = page.locator(".project-card").all()
        for project in projects:
            assert "Company2" in project.text_content()
        
        browser.close()

Your Tasks:
Identify Flakiness Issues: List all problems that could cause intermittent failures
Explain Root Causes: Why do these issues happen in CI/CD vs local environment?
Provide Fixes: Write the corrected version with proper waits, error handling, and reliability improvements
Additional Context (you may need to ask for more):
App uses dynamic loading for dashboard elements
Login process includes 2FA for some users
Different tenants have different loading times
CI runs on different browsers and screen sizes

Part 2: Test Framework Design (25 minutes)
Design a test automation framework structure for this B2B SaaS platform. Note: Requirements are intentionally incomplete.
Given Requirements:
Support web (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and mobile (iOS, Android) testing
Handle multiple tenant environments (company1.workflowpro.com, company2.workflowpro.com)
Test different user roles (Admin, Manager, Employee) with varying permissions
API testing for backend services
Integration with BrowserStack for cross-platform testing
CI/CD pipeline integration
Your Tasks:
Framework Structure: Design folder structure, base classes, and utilities
Configuration Management: How to handle multiple environments, browsers, and test data
Identify Missing Requirements: What questions would you ask about test data management, reporting, parallel execution, etc.?
Format: Use text/pseudocode/diagrams to explain your design

Part 3: API + UI Integration Test (35 minutes)
Create a test that validates the complete flow of project creation through both API and UI layers.
Business Scenario:
Create a project via API
Verify project appears correctly in web UI
Check project is accessible on mobile
Validate proper tenant isolation (project only visible to correct company)
API Endpoint Information:
POST /api/v1/projects
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {token}, X-Tenant-ID: {company_id}
Body: {"name": "Test Project", "description": "...", "team_members": [...]}
Response: {"id": 123, "name": "Test Project", "status": "active"}

Your Tasks:
Write Integration Test: Combine pytest (API) + Playwright (UI) + BrowserStack mobile testing
Handle Test Data: Show how you'd manage test data across API/UI
Cross-Platform Validation: Ensure the test works on multiple browsers and mobile devices
Tenant Isolation: Verify security boundaries between companies
Expected Test Structure:
def test_project_creation_flow():
    # 1. API: Create project
    # 2. Web UI: Verify project display
    # 3. Mobile: Check mobile accessibility
    # 4. Security: Verify tenant isolation
    pass

Your Tasks:
Implement the test using pytest + Playwright + BrowserStack concepts
Handle edge cases (network failures, slow loading, mobile responsiveness)
Explain approach with comments on your testing strategy
Hints: You'll need to make assumptions about authentication, test data cleanup, and mobile testing setup.

Submission Instructions
Create a document with your responses to all three parts
Include reasoning for each technical decision
List assumptions about missing requirements or unclear specifications
Show test framework thinking - not just individual test cases
Be prepared to discuss testing strategy and tool choices in live session

Live Session Topics (Preview)
During our video call, we'll discuss:
Your approach to debugging flaky tests and prevention strategies
Framework design decisions and scalability considerations
How you'd handle test data management in multi-tenant environments
